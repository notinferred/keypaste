# Build plan

This plan owns the committed tasks, grouped by product track: each task's dependencies, detail and acceptance evidence for [PRODUCT](PRODUCT.md) v1.12 (D-0430). [ROADMAP](../ROADMAP.md) owns direction, track order and which tasks each milestone needs. [FEATURES](FEATURES.md) owns the capability inventory, [RELEASE](RELEASE.md) distribution evidence, [BACKLOG](BACKLOG.md) optional work, and the [step records](steps/README.md) what each completed task did. The license remains AGPL-3.0.

This file holds open work only. Needs are build dependencies; time and human acts are never Needs, and a Human row is its own track. Ships after names publication gates. External signing identities are inputs, not a queue of enrollment code. A ready row does not authorize publication, account changes or messages. Preserve the secret-path tests, real KeePassXC compatibility, stale-write refusals and release integrity checks while changing product scope.

## K and B — Build infrastructure

These rows serve every track: a development machine builds only the compile check (D-0468), and CI runs every check in parallel on every run (D-0423). ROADMAP places them in 0.5.0 by founder direction of 2026-09-30.

## T3 — AI requests in the app

Every release still needs a person's answer or a rule they set, and the bridge stays vault-free (PRODUCT §§2 and 3.2). The bridge, the in-app prompt (4.4), the Agents screen (4.3b) and connecting from the app (2.6a) are reused.

- [ ] **N.8 — Make `keypaste` alone show where things stand.** Needs: G.1.
  - On a terminal it shows the version, the chosen vault and who holds it, the connected tools and one next step.
  - It asks for no password.
- [ ] **N.9 — Give each CLI concept one name.** Needs: none.
  - `approve` for the terminal approver, and `clients` for per-client choices.
  - The old spellings are removed, with no aliases (D-0416).

## T5 — Desktop delivery

The Windows MSI, the Linux AppImage and the macOS DMG are internal candidates. Existing install and upgrade observations remain useful, but they are repeated for the product that [ROADMAP](../ROADMAP.md) puts in 0.5.0.

Package managers and agent marketplaces carry a version only after it is published. keypaste.com keeps its "no `curl | sh`" stance: the one-command routes are the package managers and the signed installers.

- [ ] **3.5a — Enable the macOS signing identity (H-0015).** Human. Needs: none.
  - External Apple Developer enrollment as keypaste.
  - Repository-scoped Developer ID Application and notarization credentials.
- [ ] **3.5b — Sign and notarize macOS release payloads.** Needs: 4.7a2. Input: 3.5a's credentials.
  - First, a branch preflight with ad-hoc signing settles a bundle layout `codesign` can seal, and the hardened-runtime entitlements. The CoreCLR payload may have to move out of `Contents/MacOS`.
  - Then the app is signed inside-out, notarized and stapled.
  - `spctl` accepts it, and a changed byte is refused.
  - Terminal must be seen running the launcher of a downloaded bundle macOS opened. On `macos-15` Gatekeeper refuses an unsigned copy's launcher while it is quarantined ([4.7e1](steps/4.7e1.md)).
- [ ] **R.1a — Exercise the integrated desktop candidate.** Needs: 9.4, 4.6, F.15, U.2, U.3, 4.4b, 4.3b, 2.6a, E.1b, E.1c, F.2b3a, F.2b3b, V.7a, V.7b, C.2, N.1a, N.1b, N.2, N.3, N.4, N.5, N.6, N.7, N.10, N.12, C.1a, C.1b, C.1c, C.3, C.4, E.1d, C.5a, C.5b, G.1, G.2, G.4a, G.5, G.8, G.9, N.16, V.11, 4.7a2.
  - Install the internal Windows MSI, macOS DMG and Linux AppImage built at a named commit.
  - In each installed app, complete T1–T4 with a disposable vault, a real MCP client and a real child process. The acts:
    1. Open a KeePassXC database from the first run.
    2. Keep a key as a field, and review one flagged in notes.
    3. Tag its entry into a project and run the project.
    4. Edit the value and see the next run receive it.
    5. Connect a client without a vault path, and approve and deny its requests.
    6. Restore a revision, a deletion and a backup.
    7. Change access.
    8. Lock, and see later releases refused as `vault-locked`.
  - Each act records the OS and version, the package and its hash, the commit and its audit lines.
  - An unreached act leaves the row open.
- [ ] **4.7c2 — Publish and verify the first desktop release as 0.5.0.** Needs: 4.7c1, 3.5b, 4.7a2, 4.7e, G.5. Ships after: R.1a. Inputs: a verified Microsoft Artifact Signing identity as keypaste (H-0017), or the recorded cloud-HSM fallback, and 3.5a's Apple credentials.
  - Prove Windows signing with changed-byte refusal, and macOS notarization.
  - `osx-arm64` declares the `.app.zip` and the DMG. `require-release-assets.sh --publishable` requires every declared package offered, and `verify-desktop-candidate.sh` stages only the DMG, so either the zip stops being a declared package or the candidate check accepts each declared `osx-arm64` kind.
  - Then publish, through `release.yml`, immutable Windows, macOS and Linux desktop packages and the matching CLI/MCP archives as 0.5.0. This renames CHANGELOG's Unreleased section and sets the version.
  - Verify from anonymous downloads: public hashes, provenance, signatures and notarization, and an upgrade that keeps the vault, `~/.keypaste` and the recent list.
  - Rehearsal certificates, unpublished artifacts and source builds do not pass.
- [ ] **L.3 — Write the safe-agent guide.** Needs: none.
  - How to run Claude Code, Codex and Cursor so the agent cannot write `~/.keypaste` or its own MCP configuration and cannot read other processes, on each system, and what keypaste still cannot stop (T-14, T-35, T-36).
- [ ] **R.1b — Round-trip a tagged entry through the phone apps (H-0024).** Human. Needs: none.
  - Tag an entry and give it a protected env field in keypaste, edit that entry in KeePassium, Strongbox and KeePassDX, and confirm keypaste still reads the tag, the field and its protection; record each app's version.
- [ ] **L.1 — Make the released app understandable and reachable.** Needs: 4.7c2, L.3.
  - README, keypaste.com and the guides lead with the v1.8 positioning and name 0.5.0.
  - They link its three desktop downloads, hashes and verification steps.
  - They take a new user from the download to a working vault, a project run and a connected agent, as that version behaves.
  - They give the issue route and the private security-reporting route.
  - The launch copy says what keypaste adds over Varlock's KeePass plugin, Strongbox MCP and 1Password Environments, and links the safe-agent guide (L.3).
  - The guides name only the phone apps R.1b's round-trip passed.
  - Published claims are checked against the published binaries (D-0036).
  - The install blocks move from `keypaste-mcp` to `keypaste mcp`, and `verify-install.sh`'s bridge check moves with them ([F.48](steps/F.48.md)).
  - No announcement, message or signup mail is authorized by this row.
- [ ] **R.1 — Accept the installed local product.** Needs: 4.7c2, L.1.
  - Repeat every R.1a act on clean Windows, macOS and Linux desktops, from public 0.5.0 bytes checked against their hashes and provenance.
  - The acts are made offline after installation, with no account.
  - `install.yml` passes on the four CLI/MCP targets.
  - RELEASE records Installation-verified only for the targets that passed.
- [ ] **3.7a — Publish Homebrew installation and updates.** Needs: none. Ships after: 4.7c2. Input: H-0023.
  - A formula for the CLI and a cask for the app, both generated from completed release manifests.
  - Client registrations survive `brew upgrade`.
- [ ] **3.7b — Publish Scoop installation and updates.** Needs: none. Ships after: 4.7c2. Input: H-0023.
  - A Scoop bucket entry for the Windows payloads.
- [ ] **3.7c — Publish winget installation and updates.** Needs: none. Ships after: 4.7c2. Input: H-0023.
  - winget manifests for the signed MSI, with a stable publisher identity.
  - Closes O-0011 with its siblings.
- [ ] **G.6a — Offer keypaste as a Claude Code plugin.** Needs: G.1. Ships after: 4.7c2.
  - A marketplace manifest, the bridge registration, and a skill telling agents to use keypaste rather than ask for a pasted secret.
  - It is kept on a branch until then, because a push to `main` publishes it.
- [ ] **G.6b — Offer a Claude Desktop extension.** Needs: G.1. Ships after: 4.7c2.
  - An `.mcpb` bundle whose small launcher starts the installed bridge rather than carrying its own copy.
- [ ] **G.6c — List keypaste in the MCP Registry.** Needs: G.6b. Ships after: 4.7c2. Input: H-0022.
  - The registry takes `.mcpb` files only from GitHub or GitLab releases, which RELEASE does not use as a channel.
  - H-0022 decides the namespace, and whether a verified GitHub Release copy is acceptable.
- [ ] **G.6d — Offer a Gemini CLI extension.** Needs: G.1. Ships after: 4.7c2.
  - It registers the same bridge, with the same rules for agents.
- [ ] **G.6e — Publish Cursor and VS Code install links.** Needs: G.1. Ships after: 4.7c2.
  - The links are composed from the same registration `setup` writes.
  - They are used in the app, in `setup` output and on the site.
- [ ] **G.7 — Publish a one-prompt setup page.** Needs: G.3, G.6e. Ships after: 4.7c2.
  - A keypaste.com page with one prompt an agent can follow: install through a verified channel, run `keypaste setup` and `keypaste doctor`, and never ask for a pasted secret.
  - `verify-demo.sh` checks its commands.
- [ ] **L.2b — Move the guides onto keypaste.com.** Needs: L.1.
  - The guides L.1 rewrites move into `site/web` as their only home, and the repository keeps links to them; the checks that read `docs/demo.md` and the other transcript pages follow them.
  - The content pages gain a content security policy, checked in a browser against search and the diagrams.

## T6 — Daily driver

Each row keeps its historical meaning and is expanded when selected.

- [ ] **4.10a — Add Windows quick unlock.** Needs: none. Ships after: 4.7c2.
  - Resume a locked session with Windows Hello, keeping the full unlock path intact.
- [ ] **4.10b — Add macOS quick unlock.** Needs: 3.5b. Ships after: 4.7c2.
  - Touch ID, under the same session policy, using the signed app's entitlements.
- [ ] **9.2a — Implement interoperable TOTP.** Needs: V.7a.
  - Read and calculate KeePassXC `otp` attributes, keeping the seed protected.
- [ ] **9.2b — Use TOTP in the app and approval bridge.** Needs: 9.2a.
  - Show the code and its countdown.
  - Let an agent be approved for a code, but never for the seed.
- [ ] **8.1 — Install and pair the native messaging host.** Needs: none.
  - Start with a discovery: can keypaste serve the existing KeePassXC-Browser extension's protocol, as KeePassNatMsg does for KeePass 2?
  - Either way, pair only to specific extension identities, under the approval rules of §3.
- [ ] **8.3a — Fill a login with verified origin matching.** Needs: 8.1.
  - Fill only on the real registrable domain.
  - Refuse lookalikes and cross-origin frames.
- [ ] **1.4a — Specify merge and deletion semantics.** Needs: none.
  - For a vault synced as a file, decide how an external save and local changes combine without silently losing either.
- [ ] **1.4b — Implement atomic entry-level merge.** Needs: 1.4a.
  - Merge an external save instead of refusing agents until a person reloads.
- [ ] **9.1a — Define a loss-aware import pipeline.** Needs: V.7a.
  - One import contract, with preview, collision decisions and atomic commit, so nothing is dropped silently.
  - Its adapters, each Needs 9.1a: 9.1b (Bitwarden JSON), 9.1c (LastPass CSV), 9.1d1 (1Password 1PUX), 9.1d2 (1Password CSV) and 9.1e (KeePassXC CSV).
  - 9.1f guides import in the desktop.
- [ ] **V.9 — Report local password health.** Needs: C.2.
  - Find weak, reused and expired credentials locally, with no network request.
  - Report them in the same Recommendations list.
- [ ] **P.1 — Hardware-key vault unlocking.** Needs: V.1b, U.2. Ships after: R.1.
  - The desktop already unlocks a vault that needs a YubiKey slot and changes the key in Settings (D-0366), but this has not been tried with a physical key.
  - What remains:
    - creating such a vault;
    - opening it from the CLI and `keypaste approve`;
    - real-device unlock, save and reopen with KeePassXC interoperability;
    - missing-key and wrong-key refusal;
    - documented spare-key and lost-key limits.
  - OS quick unlock and browser passkeys are separate features.

## T7 — Agents without values

PRODUCT v1.9 (D-0400) adds T7–T10 after the first desktop release, v1.10 (D-0408) adds the cloud vault to T8 and adds T11, and v1.12 (D-0430) adds X.17 to T7. Each row carries its purpose until it is selected and detailed.

- [ ] **X.1 — Attach approved credentials on the wire.** Needs: none.
  - The process holding the vault proxies an agent's HTTPS requests to the hosts an entry names and attaches the entry's credential under a grant the person approved; the agent holds only a placeholder (PRODUCT §2, §3.2).
  - The agent asks by host; the owner matches it to an entry's service, the person picks a personal or team entry, and the agent learns only that service, its scope and its grant (D-0405).
  - The owner writes the audit record of every request it serves.
- [ ] **X.17 — Let an agent organize the vault without seeing values.** Needs: none.
  - By default the agent sees names and structure only, never a value, and note text counts as a value; the person may allow it to read a vault's note text, told that the text then reaches the agent's provider (PRODUCT §2).
  - It proposes changes such as classifying notes, moving keys into fields or tagging entries for projects; each change is applied only once the person approves it in the app, and one that moves an item into or out of an agent's reach, such as tagging it into a project an agent can see, is flagged as such before the person approves it.
  - Every name the agent reads reaches its provider, and a planted entry name can steer it, for example into proposing a move into a project an agent is Automatic for (T-13).

## T8 — Cloud vault and team projects

- [ ] **X.2 — Specify the end-to-end sharing protocol.** Needs: none.
  - Member key pairs, a project key wrapped for each member, roles, and removal by re-wrapping and rotation, built from mature audited libraries (§3.6).
  - Accounts and a person's encrypted vault, the relay's first client, and one store per team that the app keeps, never inside the personal vault (D-0406).
  - Reviewed against §3 and §4.3 before any relay code.
- [ ] **X.3 — Run the relay.** Needs: X.2.
  - A relay on keypaste.com, and one a team runs itself, storing only ciphertext and wrapped keys: one C# service on .NET, which X.10 and X.13 extend (D-0409).
- [ ] **X.10 — Sync a person's vault through the relay.** Needs: X.3, 1.4b.
  - At first run everyone is offered an account and a cloud vault as the default choice: the KDBX encrypted on the device under the master password and a key file that is never uploaded, and merged across devices (D-0408).
  - Keeping the vault local stays one choice away and needs no account.
- [ ] **X.11 — Recover a cloud vault with a kit or a signed-in device.** Needs: X.10.
  - The recovery kit holds the key file as a QR code, the account address and a space for the master password; a device still signed in can set a new password. No copy of the key exists anywhere else (§3.1).
- [ ] **X.12 — Charge for the cloud past its free tier.** Needs: X.10.
  - Free up to a size limit, premium for more storage and features, and business use paid as it is used; no security feature is paid (§5.4).
- [ ] **X.4 — Share a project with members.** Needs: X.3.
  - Invite, roles for reading, writing and production, and removal with rotation reminders, in the app and the CLI.
  - A record of who fetched what.

## T9 — CI and deploys

- [ ] **X.5 — Verify machine identities at the relay.** Needs: X.3.
  - A CI job or deploy target fetches a project's values under an identity the relay verifies, never a member's key.
- [ ] **X.6 — Offer a GitHub Action.** Needs: X.5.
- [ ] **X.7 — Push syncs from a member's machine.** Needs: X.4.
  - Hosting platforms such as GitHub, Vercel and Cloudflare receive values from an approved member's machine, so the relay never decrypts.

## T10 — Organizations

- [ ] **X.8 — Sign in with SSO and provision with SCIM.** Needs: X.4.
- [ ] **X.9 — Approve production changes, export the audit and package the relay.** Needs: X.4.
  - A production change waits for a second member's approval, the relay's records export to an organization's log store, and the self-hosted relay ships as a package.

## T11 — Server access by choice

- [ ] **X.13 — Let a team project opt into server access.** Needs: X.4.
  - Once a team opts a project in, the relay's .NET service on keypaste.com or the team's own holds its key (D-0409); members see which projects a server can read, and the server's records reach each member's local log (§3.3).
  - Reviewed against §3 and §4.3 before any code.
- [ ] **X.14 — Proxy agents running in the cloud.** Needs: X.13, X.1.
- [ ] **X.15 — Let CI sign in with OIDC and store no secret.** Needs: X.13.
- [ ] **X.16 — Sync opted-in projects to hosting platforms from the server.** Needs: X.13.

## Completion

The [current release matrix](RELEASE.md#current-distribution--2026-09-07) owns public availability: a completed source step does not mean the behavior is in the current download.
